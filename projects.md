> An incomplete list of things I've worked on for fun (in no particular order).

##### TripBuddy.SG

Company \| September 2015 - September 2016 \| [GitHub](https://github.com/TripBuddySG)

'TripBuddy.SG' is an online platform that aims to bridge the gap between international students & local students in Singaporean tertiary institutes in an attempt to promote cultural exchange. It does this by providing a space where local students can host short trips to authentic local destinations for international students. The working beta of the online platform was built using Django, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, jQuery & various social media APIs. It was deployed on a DigitalOcean droplet running Ubuntu.

##### CommandPlus

NUS Hack&Roll 2017 \| January 2017 \| [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/CommandPlus)

'CommandPlus' is a Chrome extension that provides hand gesture based control of one's browser. It does this by interacting with the user's webcam and sending video frames from the live feed to a Python server running OpenCV for gesture detection using computer vision. If one of the predefined gestures is detected, it triggers the relevant action in the browser. The extension is aimed at helping individuals who are limited in their movement or fine motor skills and won the People's Choice Award at NUS Hack&Roll 2017.

##### CodeBot

Facebook SG Hackathon 2016 \| September 2016 \| [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/CodeBot)

'CodeBot' is a chatbot that helps beginners learn how to code. To make the otherwise daunting task of learning how to code for the first time easier, CodeBot incorporates witty replies, GIFs & human-readable errors to create an incredibly fun experience for a complete novice. Currently, it goes through a few elementary exercises in Python while answering user questions using basic NLP. The back-end was built using Node.js, MongoDB & api.ai while the front-end is written in vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

##### InstaFeast

NUS Hack&Roll 2016 \| January 2016 \| [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/InstaFeast)

'InstaFeast' is a simple web application that allows users to check the top Instagram posts of food & drinks at their desired location. Using the Google Maps API, Facebook Graph API, Instagram API & an external face detection API, the app filters through recent Instagram posts from the user-defined location and returns the top posts of food & drinks. The back-end is built on top of Django while the front-end is written in vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript with Bootstrap.

##### When We Meet Again

NUS Hack&Roll 2015 \| January 2015 \| [DevPost](http://devpost.com/software/when-we-meet-again)

'When We Meet Again' is an Android application that uses the relative distance between users, determined using the phone's Bluetooth, to trigger a reminder/push notification. My team and I built a working prototype of the app with my team during NUS Hack&Roll 2015, where it fetched us the Best Freshmen Award. It was also featured & staff-picked on [DevPost](http://devpost.com/software/when-we-meet-again).

##### WWMAPulse

Hackathon@SG 2015 \| July 2015 \| [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/WWMAPulse)

'WWMAPulse' is the second iteration of 'When We Meet Again' that my team and I built during Hackathon@SG 2015. WWMAPulse is also an Android app that triggers a push notification based on the proximity of users, however, instead of using Bluetooth to determine the proximity, it uses *Pulse*, a proprietary feature of the Razer Nabu X (wearable by Razer).

##### WhyBills

Facebook SG Hackathon 2015 \| February 2015 \| [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/WhyBills)

'WhyBills' is a system that aims to eliminate the need for printed bills/receipts at retail outlets. The POS Java app combined with the consumer-side Android app allows the entire bill to be transferred to the consumer's phone via a simple QR Code. In addition to being a convenient way for the consumer to store his/her bills, the Android app also acts as an effective expense tracker.

##### BootstrapCards

Bootstrap Template \| May 2015 - Present \| [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/BootstrapCards)

'BootstrapCards' is a Boostrap template I created for my personal website. It implements card-based web design and consists of templates for one-pagers (like this website) & multi-page blogs. It is open sourced and actively maintained on GitHub. A demo of the template can be found [here](http://suyashlakhotia.com/BootstrapCards/).

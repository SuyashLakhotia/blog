title: An Introduction
---

My name is **Suyash Lakhotia** and I'm currently in between my junior year and senior year of college in Singapore. I'm originally from India but I spent all my formative years in Jakarta, Indonesia, which I proudly call home.

Professionally, I'm a Computer Science major but I also dabble with [photography](https://500px.com/SuyashL), dance and now this blog. I'm extremely passionate about technology (software, in particular) and I usually have the same answer when people ask me why.

> In which other field can you change the world with just a laptop, an Internet connection and a couple cups of coffee?

I love creating and building things I can call my own and I'm driven to get more people to share this passion with me. Personally, I don't think we can ever have *enough* creators, innovators and builders around us.

### Why blogging?

I've been thinking about starting a blog *of sorts* for the longest time now. The reason I say "of sorts" is because I want this to be a space where I can store my ideas, share my experiences and keep track of my progress in life, and I don't really know if that falls under the conventional definition of a "blog". *Maybe this is more of a journal?*

Right off the bat, I don't know how often I will be posting, how long I plan to do this and if anyone will ever read anything I write here. But that's not really the point of this. I just want to build content that I can look back on later.

Anyway, this little space on the Internet will be a collection of my thoughts, ideas and occasional rants on topics that catch my attention. I will be talking about the software projects I work on, places I travel to and observations I have on the world around me. *Bit of a stretch?* Perhaps, but we'll work with it for now.

So...here goes nothing.

```python
print("Hello, World!");
```
